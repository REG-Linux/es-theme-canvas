## **Configuration Options**

- This theme has a simple set of options that can be changed directly from the UI Settings menu of ES-DE

   - `16:9`
   - `16:10`
   - `4:3`
   - `19.5:9`
   - `1:1`
     
- `Theme Variant` - Canvas features combinations of a grid/carousel system view that will scale based on font size. A gamelist view of either textlist or grid gamelist view. Additionally, two styles of system logos are available: Art or Icons. All variants will scale the size of the gamelist and the amount of metadata shown based on the selected font size. `Large` and `X-Large` will reduce metadata shown on all screens:
  
   - `[Grid] Textlist` - A system grid with a simple text list of games and metadata on the left.

   - `[Grid] Carousel` - A system grid with a carousel of games and metadata on the left.
     
   - `[Grid] Grid: Basic` - A system grid with a grid of boxart and minimal metadata for games.
